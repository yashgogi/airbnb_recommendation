Tom and Wonder are fabulous hosts. Tom sent me a message very soon after making the reservation and he was always easy to reach and very responsive. And he seems as laid back as you want him to be. Need directions or restaurant recommendations? He's your man. Need a dinner or walking companion? He's your man. Want to be left alone to read, too. Whatever you need,0.6369,4,5,5

We hit a cold snap and had to use the space heater.  It worked quite well.  I'd be concerned about being the person on the right side of the bed, bring an eye shade.  Worked for me.  Noise level was minimal from the neighborhood.  If guests are staying upstairs,0,2,3,3

The top floor of Christina's home is lovely, with the master bedroom facing onto a fenced in deck area,0,2,3,3
We had two issues during our trip. There was no A/C installed at the time of my trip. I called Christina once we realized that and she informed us that the bedrooms cool off significantly at night, that bedroom smelled strongly like natural gas/chemicals. It was strong enough to cause a headache. I sent Christina a message around 10pm letting her know that I wasn't sure I'd be able to sleep in that room as a result,0,2,3,3

When we got into the house we found out that it was empty. Hermina told me that she would not be there previously and that a Housekeeper ( Donna) would be there. I found out later on a post-it on the fridge saying that she only gets in the house a few hours during the day to clean up. When I got to our room ( room C) I was very appointed. The room was in the attic, I didn't like that my mother had to take it. In the room,-0.1419,2,2.7162,3

What made my entire stay enjoyable were the details: the extra cup of coffee Meg brews for you (and your +1); Wally (who is such a darling); great conversations with Meg the times we did cross paths; the view of the sunset from the dining room.  I didn't spend too much time in the apartment, although I hear you're certainly welcome to do so.  The details in the post are all on point. Walking up the 3 flights of stairs was not bad at all.  I took the T everyday,0,2,3,3

Mona was my first AB&B host and she was very ready for her guests. The rooms (being small in the city) were comfortable and clean. Mona met us on-time, but it was normal apartment living and did not bother us. Because we were in a large college town parking was tricky. Mona said summertime was the best time to find open parking spots and after on 20 minutes we found a good and safe spot on a side street near by. Be sure to follow the no parking signs seriously,0.128,3,3.256,3

Hilary's home is very personal and reflective of her.  The work and love put in her home is evident.  The room you are staying in is at the top of the stairs (all the bedrooms are upstairs) and it is a cozy 4th bedroom as advertised.   There is a shared bathroom downstairs (and very large).  The bed can easily accommodate 2 people.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, bookcase,0.5563,4,4.1126,4

We were located in room B. When we arrived nobody was there to welcome us. We knew Hermina was out of the country and Donna the house-keeper but we didn't have the chance to meet her during our all stay in Hermina's house. We didn't have a very good experience unfortunately. When we arrived room was not clean  (however we knew it, we had to leave the door of our room unlocked  for Donna to come and clean the room.

The house is beautiful and looks like the photos that Hermina has displayed.  I loved walking into a Victorian home!  You can tell she takes a lot of pride in her place and makes it nice for travelers.  My room was already pretty cool when I arrived, and dressers to unpack in.  I used the shower to clean up after a full day of travel.  The water pressure was good.  It is a shared bathroom between I think two or three rooms,-0.34,2,2.32,2

Amenities - this small cozy single bed room was adorable. I can't remember when I last slept in a single bed but all I can say is this one was very comfortable and the room had everything you need. A dresser, AC. The living space is shared with another room (of up to 2 people) and as I understand another room will soon be available.  You have access to a fully equipped kitchen,0,2,3,3
